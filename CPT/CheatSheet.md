| Warm-up set             | 1-2 sets at a low intensity to psychologically and physiologically prepare for the resistance training exercise |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single set              | Performing one set of each exercise                          |
| Multiple set            | Performing a multiple number of sets for each exercise       |
| Pyramid                 | Increasing (or decreasing) weight with each set              |
| Superset                | Performing two exercises in rapid succession with minimal rest |
| Complex training        | Performing a multijoint or compound exercise, with a heavy load, immediately followed by an explosive movement (e.g., a barbell squat then a vertical jump) |
| Drop set                | Performing a set to failure, then removing a small percentage of the load and continuing with the set |
| Giant set               | Performing four or more exercises in rotation with as little rest as possible between sets |
| Rest pause              | Incorporating a slight pause between repetitions within a series of sets |
| Circuit training        | Performing a series of exercises, one after the other, with minimal rest |
| Peripheral heart action | A variation of circuit training that alternates upper and lower body exercises throughout the set |
| Split routine           | A resistance training routine that trains different body parts on separate days |
| Vertical loading        | A form of training in which strength training exercises are performed in rapid succession, starting with the upper " " |
