#### Radius and Ulna

<img src="9-elbow.assets/180-1.jpg" alt="Figure" style="zoom:50%;" />

+ Medial to the olecranon process is a groove through which the ulnar nerve transverses. Hitting your “funny bone” in this area can produce a tingling sensation as the ulnar nerve receives the mechanical stimulation. 

### JOINTS

#### Humeroulnar and Humeroradial Joints

During elbow flexion, the radial head slides into the radial fossa. As the elbow reaches full extension, there is no contact between the articular surfaces.

##### **Capsule, Ligaments, and Bursae**

+ The ulnar or medial collateral ligament (MCL), the radial or lateral collateral ligament (LCL), and the annular ligament reinforce the capsule on its medial and lateral surfaces, adding to the stability of the elbow complex ([Fig. 9.4](https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9780803675056/epub/OPS/c09.xhtml?favre=brett#fig9-4)).

+ A **valgus angle** is defined as one where the distal bone of a joint is angled outward, away from the body. A valgus stress results from a stress applied to the lateral side of the elbow that increases the valgus angle at the elbow. 
  + A varus stress to the elbow results from a force applied to the medial aspect of the elbow.
+ A **varus angle** describes the relationship between two bones in which the distal bone is angled toward the midline of the body.  
+ The posterior portion of the MCL attaches to the posterior aspect of the medial humeral epicondyle and the ulnar coronoid and olecranon processes. This portion of the ligament limits elbow extension. The transverse fibers of the MCL connect the olecranon and the ulnar coronoid processes and help maintain congruent joint surfaces

+ The LCL is a fan-shaped ligament that includes radial and ulnar portions of the ligament. The radial portion attaches to the inferior lateral humeral epicondyle and merges with the annular ligament that surrounds the major portion of the radial head. It blends with the joint capsule and is reinforced by the LCL. The ulnar portion attaches the lateral humeral epicondyle to the lateral ulna and annular ligament. The LCL stabilizes the elbow against a varus stress to the elbow. Along with the annular ligament, the LCL contributes to elbow joint rotational and posterolateral stability

+ There are seven major bursae in the elbow complex. A large bursa is located between the olecranon and the olecranon fossa. This olecranon bursa disperses forces as the olecranon compresses into the olecranon fossa during elbow extension.

##### **Clinical Connection 9.1**

- Repetitive valgus loading is common in athletic activities, especially in overhanded pitching motions. 
  - During the cocking and acceleration phases of the pitch, the MCL is the most vulnerable to injury. 
  - At high loads, the MCL must rely on the triceps brachii, anconeus, wrist flexors, and forearm pronators to increase dynamic stabilization at the elbow. 
  - Athletes with this type of injury often complain of pain on the medial aspect of the elbow that worsens during elbow motion. 
  - The area can be tender on palpation, and swelling may or may not be present. 
  - Factors that make one more prone to this type of injury during athletic activity include inadequate range of motion at the shoulder, throwing technique, weakness of the dynamic muscle stabilizers of the elbow, and overall balance and core stability.

##### **Kinematics**

- Flexion and extension occur at the proximal elbow complex but a small amount of rotation also occurs at the end ranges; thus, the humeroulnar and humeroradial articulations are classified as “modified” hinge joints. 
- Active elbow flexion range of motion averages 145°, and passive ranges increase to 160°
- Most functional activities require elbow active range of motion between 30° and 130°.
- During flexion, the ulnar trochlear notch rolls and glides anteriorly over the trochlear groove ([Fig. 9.6](https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9780803675056/epub/OPS/c09.xhtml?favre=brett#fig9-6)). The proximal radial head rolls and glides anteriorly over the capitulum during flexion, pulling the head of the radius against the capitulum. The radial head fits into the radial fossa at the end range of elbow flexion.

- Once full extension is reached, the radius has no contact with the humerus.

##### **Carrying Angle**

+ Cubital varus, in which the forearm is medial to the humerus, is not a typical position and usually is the result of a distal humeral fracture. 
+ The carrying angle varies but is approximately 15°. Women, on average, have a carrying angle 2°greater than men. 
+ The carrying angle may assist with the biomechanical efficiency of bringing the hand to the mouth. When a person is carrying objects in the hand, the angle tends to keep objects away from the side of the body.

## ELBOW COMPLEX MUSCLES

+ long head of the biceps attaches to the supraglenoid fossa of the scapula and crosses over the shoulder joint and the humeroulnar joint before attaching distally to the radius. Because of these attachments, the biceps is able to flex the shoulder, flex the elbow, and supinate the forearm. 
+ muscles that attach to the radius can contribute to pronation and supination even though they produce other movements at the elbow. 

##### **Clinical Connection 9.2**

+ A sudden pull on an extended elbow when the forearm is pronated can result in radial head subluxation and annular ligament displacement. This injury is referred to as nursemaid’s elbow, annular ligament displacement, pulled elbow, or radial head subluxation. 
+ It is often seen in young children and occurs when an adult is holding a child’s hand when the child stumbles and falls. As the adult pulls on the child’s arm to try to prevent the fall, the child’s radial head is pulled from its articulation with the proximal humerus. This injury is a common reason for emergency department visits in young children.

### ELBOW FLEXORS

- primary mover: biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis. 
- assist: wrist flexor muscles, along with pronator teres

#### Biceps Brachii

+ long head of the biceps originates on the scapula at the supraglenoid tubercle in the glenoid fossa. 
+ short head originates at the coracoid process of the scapula. 
+ Because the long head is the only portion of the muscle that travels through the humeral bicipital groove to cross the shoulder joint to attach to the scapula, it is the only head that acts on the shoulder to produce shoulder flexion. 
+ fuse to form one belly before attaching as one tendon to the radius. 
+ The biceps brachii are selectively activated during movement that requires elbow flexion and forearm supination and have the ability to produce the greatest torque between 90° and slightly more than 100° of flexion.

+ During functional activities that require a large flexion force, combining elbow flexion with shoulder extension enhances the ability of the biceps to produce a force. An example of this motion is during a resisted pulling activity. As the posterior deltoid extends the shoulder, it enhances the force potential of the biceps. The extended position reduces the net shortening of the biceps and slows its contraction velocity. 

#### Brachialis

+ The brachialis muscle is considered the “workhorse” of the arm because of its large cross-sectional area. 
+ The muscle lies deep to the biceps, originating on the distal half of the humerus. 
+ Because it attaches to the ulna, not the radius, it is always recruited during elbow flexion whether the forearm is pronated or supinated and regardless of the angle of the elbow or force required to perform the task. 
+ Because the brachialis crosses only one joint, the elbow, it acts only on the elbow. 
+ The brachialis muscle is able to exert its greatest force at approximately 90° of elbow flexion

#### Brachioradialis

- The brachioradialis muscle attaches proximally on the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus. 
- Its muscle belly is located mainly in the forearm before the muscle attaches distally to the radial styloid process. 
- The brachioradialis generates maximum torque between 100° and 120° of elbow flexion as it flexes the elbow and rotates the forearm into a neutral position. 
- This elbow flexor also has a secondary role in forearm pronation and supination because of its radius attachment. 

### ELBOW EXTENSORS

- Primary: The triceps brachii 
- anconeus contributes only a small percentage of the total force. 
- When the shoulder flexors are active during elbow extension, they counter the function of the long head of the triceps to extend the shoulder.


#### Triceps Brachii

+  long head, the medial head, and the lateral head. 
+ long head of the triceps originates on the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula glenoid fossa. Because it crosses the shoulder joint, it assists with shoulder extension in addition to extending the elbow. 
+  lateral and medial heads of the triceps originate on the respective sides of the posterior humerus; the medial head is deep to the long and lateral heads. The three portions of the triceps brachii converge to form a common tendon that attaches to the ulna via the olecranon process 

<img src="9-elbow.assets/188-1.jpg" alt="Figure" style="zoom:50%;" />

#### Anconeus

- The anconeus is a small triangular muscle on the posterolateral aspect of the elbow. Its fibers are located between the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and blend with the posterolateral joint capsule of the elbow. 
- contributes to the joint’s lateral stability 
- law of parsimony: the number of muscle fibers recruited by the nervous system depends on the amount of torque needed to complete the task. The nervous system recruits the fewest muscles needed. 
  - Activities that require minimal extensor forces most likely involve just the anconeus and the medial head of the triceps. 
  - As demands increase, the lateral head and the long head of the triceps are recruited to provide the forces needed for elbow extension. 

### FOREARM SUPINATORS AND PRONATORS

- The biceps brachii and the supinator are the primary supinator muscles of the forearm. 
- The supinator originates on the lateral humeral epicondyle, the lateral collateral and annular ligaments, and the ulna and attaches to the proximal one third of the radius
  - The supinator is twisted around the radius and supplies sufficient torque for forearm supination when the movement occurs slowly or against minimal resistance. 
  - When moderate or heavy force is required, the biceps brachii is activated in addition to the supinator and can generate the greatest torque when the elbow is flexed to approximately 90°. 
  - The brachioradialis plays a small role as a secondary supinator. 
  - When the forearm is in full pronation, the brachioradialis assists in rotating the forearm to midrange between full pronation and supination.

<img src="9-elbow.assets/188-2.jpg" alt="Figure" style="zoom:50%;" />

- The pronator teres and pronator quadratus are the muscles primarily responsible for forearm pronation. 
- pronator teres originates on the medial epicondyle of the humerus, inserting on the lateral surface of the middle radial shaft. 
  - The median nerve passes right through the belly of the muscle, which can be a site for nerve compression. 
- pronator quadratus originates at the distal end of the forearm on the anterior surfaces of the ulna and radius. It produces forearm pronation and provides dynamic stabilization to the distal radioulnar joint 

<img src="9-elbow.assets/189-1.jpg" alt="Figure" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Shoulder lateral rotation is often paired with forearm supination, whereas medial rotation occurs with forearm pronation. 




## MUSCLE RECRUITMENT DURING FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES

- Proximal muscles often stabilize joints so that more distal joints can move on a stable base. 
- The elbow cannot flex and bring the hand to the mouth during eating unless the shoulder complex is providing a relatively stable unmovable base.

- Which muscles must act in synergy to complete a given task depends on the demands of the task in terms of the speed, force, and direction required. For example, when forearm supination is needed against resistance, such as when tightening a screw with a screwdriver, the biceps assist the supinator to provide enough force to accomplish the task. However, if the biceps were unopposed, the elbow would also flex during the motion, pulling the screwdriver away from the screw. The triceps is also recruited during this task to oppose the flexion component of the biceps. Because of the cocontraction of the biceps and the triceps, the elbow is maintained in a static flexed position while forearm supination rotates the screwdriver. The scapulothoracic and glenohumeral muscles stabilize proximally so that the shoulder complex is not moving during the forearm motion. The wrist and hand muscles stabilize the grip on the screwdriver as the forearm rotates the screwdriver
