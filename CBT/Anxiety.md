## 171121 Anxiety Attack Log

+ Symptoms
  + Extreme cravings for food
  + Anxious, want to cry (already did, actually ;P)
+ Senario 1
  + What happened
    + After an enjoyable no-internet trip, we came back to home, and start working on our work separately for a whole afternoon
    + My husband had his phone with him all the time after we came back
    + He went right into gaming after finishing his work, and it has been ~8 hrs that we did not interact minus the dinner time
  + My thoughts
    + It is so hard to go back to the no-internet time when we have full attention on each other
    + My whole life will be like this, maybe 80% of the leisure time alone
    + If we have a baby it will take up all my leisure time, and my husband will still be gaming/ using his phone and we will have even less attention on each other
      + Even if I will be a good mother, he won’t be a good father.
      + So we shouldn’t have kids
    + After all these years I’m feeling better simply because I have more time now, I have a more safe future, and I have figured out more efficient way to do all the house cleaning. Not that he is doing significantly more. It still take so much time to guide him step by step to finish even an easy house work.
  + Problem solving
    + thought 1: we shouldn’t have kids because my husband won’t be a good father
    + thought 2: I will spend most of my leisure time alone the rest of my life.
    + thought 3: Improvements in my mental condition can be majorily attributed to my own problem-solving, not my husband.
+ Senario 2
  + What happened
    + I had some burger/ fries/ ice cream during the trip
    + I just bought some keto snacks from costco
    + I was eating
  + My thoughts
    + I shouldn’t eat more
    + I need to chew more slowly to eat mindfully
    + if I can’t eat mindfully/ control my cravings I won’t be able to maintain my body image
    + Then I will lose the only thing I’m proud of about my body
    + And I’m eating more that must be my anxiey (and now I’m anxious about my anxiety, and how it will lead to the “loss of what I’m proud of”)
    + A fear of lose control. Part of me saying eating for this time once does not putting me on great danger. But the other part says it is part of the big picture of losing control. 
  + Problem solving
    + Thought 1: I need to force myself to eat mindfully
      + Seems it’s nothing about apetite and not so much about craving. Next time try to do raisin meditation every time I feel uncontrollable urge to binge eat
    + Thought 2: I’m losing control
      + Homework: Try to find some reward scheme that everytime after doing the raisin meditation I can assert that I’m not losing control on myself. 
+ Others
  + Actually this anxiety feeling might be induced by physcial strain (tightness/ pain) accumulated throughout the trip. And the emotinal effect of the thoughts are exaggerated by the physcial tension. 
  + Watching CBT videos and writing this down is actually a good practice to deal with the acute anxiety attack
