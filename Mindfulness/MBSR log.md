+ The Power of Mindfulness: https://youtu.be/IeblJdB2-Vo
  + The philosopy of yoga didn’t pursuade me when I studied for the yoga teacher certificate. But here comes science. As a former researcher and current engineer, it is the science that gives me the belief about power of mind.
  + I couldn’t tell which part from the talk exactly, but my tears almost bursted when watching it. Maybe it was simply the beauty that comes with how the power of mind healed physical pain and brings light to everyday life.
  + I started practing saying “Good Morning, Arky” to myself every morning after brushing my teeth. It was weird and embarassing, even when my husband was deep asleep. But the moment I finished saying it, I can see the smile, the playfulness, and some subtle shyness on my face through the mirror. I suddenly realized how lovely and cute I am, cute not in the way of good looking, but lovable. I didn’t expect I could feel this much the first time trying it. That truely brought me joy right in the beginning of my day.

## Formal Practice Log

- 11/14/21 - Rasin Meditation
  - I have never tasted a rasin with such a strong flavor. It was not excessively sweet, but the bit of sourness added to the flavor. I could even taste a hint of soil in the rasin. 
  - I came to realize that, I always had such  curiosity, wondering about little details of things, their color, texture, how did they arrive here, and what are they made of. The curiosity like a child, was always in the background of my wandering mind. I was just rushing through everything too fast that I ignored them, or suppressed them because they were labeled “unproductive”. I finally realized in this practice that, such wandering of mind is not being absent, not being unproductive. On the contrary, it was the natural state of being present, being present with the object right in front of me. And it brings joy, and gratefulness for the wonder that the world and nature brings to us with such a normal object.
- 11/15/21 - Mindful Body Scan
  - Fell asleep before the clip ended. It is actually a good news because I have been suffering from intermittent insominia for quite some years, and it usually takes me at least 30mins to 1hr to fall asleep. 

- 11/17/21 - Mindful Body Scan
  - Fell asleep, my mind wandered so far that I even forgot that I was listen to the clip. But I did notice that the wandering mind was actually quieter than racing thoughts I usually had when trying to fall asleep, and I woke up more refreshed than normal. 

- 11/18/21 - Mindful Body Scan
  - Almost fell asleep (but didn’t!). Still felt hard to focus on even listening to the guide.

- 11/20/21 - Mindful Body Scan
  - Very tired after hiking, tried to meditate but my mind just got super anxious and had to stop midway.

- 11/21/21 - Mindful Body Scan
  - Tried meditation first thing in the morning this time, didn’t fall asleep (working very well!). It was the first time when I could follow the body scan from start to finish, with some minor distraction (but I was able to gently bring my mind back by saying to my self “gently bring it back”).

- 11/22/21 - Mindful Body Scan
  - In the morning again, similar to yesterday. But I woke up at 5am so I did go back to sleep after the meditation to get enough rest, which the meditation also helped.


## Informal Practice Log

+ 11/14/21- Mindful eating

  + Removed all digital devices when eating.
  + Although I was not watching or reading anything, it was still pretty hard to focus purely on the food and eat slowly. I just can’t wait swallowing the food as I have been doing for years. And my thought was racing like crazy, including thinking about mindful eating itself.
  + Before: I want to make use of every minute to learn new things, including when I’m eating.
  + While: Intense loneliness, and then started to have racing thoughts.
  + Learnt: being mindfully is easier said than done, it’s truely like building muscle strength, which involves some period of tough and unpleasant experience. 
  + While writing: still somewhat frustrated, and want to eat something now.

+ 11/15/21 - Mindful eating

  + Now that I think about mindful eating, it feels like an additional layer of burden on me when eating (plus the macro nutrients, micro nutrients, total calories etc.)
  + I feel that I am putting to much thoughts into what, when, and how to eat, which put myself constantly on a emotional strain while eating. And that does give rise to a crazy craving - binge eating - hard refrain malicious cycle.
  + Maybe I should just think less about eating, while trying to enjoy eating the process itself.
  + + Before: same as above
    + While: more anxious than I normally would be because of the thought “i need to eat mindfully”
    + Learnt: being mindfully is easier said than done, it’s truely like building muscle strength, which involves some period of tough and unpleasant experience.
    + While writing: I can give myself credit for not blaming myself on not being able to clear my thoughts.

+ 11/16/21 - No-internet retreat day 1

  + Started a two-day road trip to Big Sur, putting my phone and electronic devices away (the campground didn’t have any signal anyway)
  + Not looking at screens make my neck and shoulder pain much better!
  + Normally at night, my husband will play computer games and I will watch lectures or read books, so we don’t spend a lot of time together. But now, we can do massage on each other for a long time, have fun just chatting, go to sleep much ealier than normal and wake up refreshed.
  + + Before: normally we will spend most of the time looking at our own phones, feeling totally disconnected with the current moment.
    + While: it felt so good, that I have a “fully awake” partner, and we both have full attention on each other.
    + Learnt: I didn’t know how disconnected we were until I felt the contrast when we put full attention on each other for a full day.
    + While writing: I do feel somewhat unhappy about my husband that he was the one always on the phone, and made me feel alone if I’m do not pick up my phone. 

+ 11/17/21 - No-internet retreat day 2 

  + Left my phone in our camper van and went hiking. 
  + When there is no need to take photos, I could enjoy the colors, light and shadows, and warmness of the air much more vividly.

  + No internet even on the road, but highway No. 1 is just pure beauty. I stared at the view though the window all the time if like every second I looked away it would be a waste of such beauty.
  + My photographer husband took care of the photo-taking, so I can just enjoy everything right with my eyes.
  + + Before: normally I take pictures and start posting on social media when I see view like this.
    + While: Experiencing the view with eyes and eyes only made all the details stand out so much more.
    + Learnt: Memory is the feelings and sensations carved into the brain, but not posted on social media.
    + While writing: I still have those views in my memory so vividly, which is much more enjoyable than a social media post!

+ 11/18/21 - Mindful eating (binging …)

  + Maybe I’m tring too hard…
  + It’s a cloudy day, which usually triggers my depression/ anxiety. I pulled myself out of an anxiety attack yesterday with CBT techniques, which was actually a success. But the crave for food can be just so intense and not resistable during these days.
  + However, I did make sure every time I binged, I was looking at the food, feeling its tasts and smells. So it did bring me joy, albeit the guilt that accompanied it. 
  + I decided not to blame on myself too much on binging this time, things just take practice. 
  + + Before: During the worst time I could have uncontrollable depression or anxietly episode during these days.
    + While: although dealing with anxietly is hard, writing my thoughts down and do problem solving slowly cleared my mind and calm me down to a degree that I couldn’t even believe that I just went though an episode.
    + Learnt: sometime the best therapist is myself, if I can slow down and kindly ask myself “what is going through your mind right now?”
    + While writing: this experience feels incredible, the first time when I can rescue myself from an episode so effectively and quickly. 

+ 11/19/21 - Mindful eating

  + Slowly getting used to not multitasking when eating. I did enjoy the food much more this way.
  + After telling myself not to blame myself on eating more calories than planned or less whole food, I felt less stressful while eating. Although the craving is still hard to tackle, but I think it may be a natural rhythm for me during winter season and cloudy/ rainy weather.
  + + Before: I was blaming myself on not being able to eat mindfully
    + While: tell myself that periodical craving is not the end of the world, and I don’t need to put so much pressure on myself.
    + Learnt: sometimes self critic can make things worse.
    + While writing: I can give myself credit for not blaming myself on not being able to clear my thoughts.

+ 11/21/21 - Mindful eating

  + By asking my body very carefully what was going on, I finally got the answer! Guess what, I always know that the feeling of thirst can be misprocessed as hunger because their processor regions in brain are quite close. I did drink a lot of water but obviously it was not enough. I didn’t realize it until my ezyma flared up again and I monitored my hygrometer closely. The temperature get’s much lower these days and my heater automatically turned high, so the humidity in my room drops drastically. Now I’m drinking more water, and keep my lips moisturized with ezyma cream, and my craving gets much better now.
  + + Before: I couldn’t stop myself from eating
    + While: I start to feel the thirst hidden under the strong thought “I want to eat”
    + Learnt: sometimes sensations and thoughts can really be mixed up, making it hard to identify the true feeling of my body
    + While writing: exploring how my own body works always brings me excitement and satisfies my curiosity!
