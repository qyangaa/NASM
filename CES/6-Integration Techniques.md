# Integration Techniques

## Science

+ Goal: Intermuscular coordination
  + reeducate the human movement system (HMS) back into a functional synergistic movement pattern, increasing multiplanar neuromuscular control
  + multiple joint actions and multiple muscle synergies helps to reestablish neuromuscular control
  + limited resistance, slower tempos, and high repetitions

### Scientific Rationale

+ some lower extremity injuries occur in relation to poor eccentric control (deceleration) of the hip, knee, and trunk in the frontal and transverse planes resulting from hip musculature weakness 

+ focuses on initially practicing eccentric deceleration slowly so that adjustments can be made.

  +  more strength gains are made compared to concentric muscle actions in isolation
  + most muscle damage, inflammation, impaired muscle function, and muscular soreness occurs; hence, the limited number of sets, especially for the newer exerciser 

+ Muscle types

  + Agonist
  + Antagonist
  + Synergists support the agonist. 
  + Stabilizers are the muscles that limit or cease undesirable action of the fixed attachment of the muscle. 
  + Neutralizers limit or cease the undesirable action of the mobile attachment site of the muscle.

+ Multijoint motions are often used because they promote and require greater intermuscular coordination to achieve the desired outcome

  + Intermuscular coordination

    The ability of different muscles in the body to work together to allow coordination of global and refined movements.

  +  strengthening of one side unilaterally can also increase the strength of the contralateral limb 

  + Overhead (often used in integrated dynamic movements), standing, and unilateral and bilateral exercises place increased stress on the core musculature

+ Exercises

  + multijoint
  + integrated dynamic movement
    + start with low load and controlled movement in ideal posture
    + progression of the movement patterns: 
      + two-legged -> staggered 0> lunge -> single leg
      + sagittal -> frontal -> transverse
  + multiplanar/ lateral

+ Unstable surfaces

  + not ideal for producing strength or power, 
  + but they may be indicated for increasing motor control via coactivations and anticipatory postural adjustments
  + Adolescents and young adults experienced different improvements in strength, strength endurance, and power. In contrast, older adults experienced the greatest improvements in static and dynamic balance.

  

  

## Guidelines

+ Precautions and contradictions
  + Precautions
    + Special populations
    + Neuromuscular disorders
  + contradictions
    + Acute injury or muscle strain or tear of the muscle being worked
    + Acute rheumatoid arthritis of the affected joint
    + Position of exercise (prone, supine, or decline position) relative to the client’s condition (pregnancy, coronary heart disease, etc.)
    + Acute injury to joint involved during movement
    + Pain
+ not all individuals will have the physical capabilities to perform many of the jump task progressions during this phase of their corrective program.
+ Acute variables
  + 3 to 5 days per week, 1 to 3 sets, 10-15 reps, 3-4 exercises, controlled duration

### Functional Movement Progressions

+ For clients who cannot participate in jumping exercises
+ begin with ball squats, then to step-ups, then to lunges, then to single-leg squats (from more stable/less dynamic to more unstable/more dynamic).
  + knee(s) in line with the toes and to not allow the knee to move medially or laterally relative to the foot to ensure proper arthrokinematics and neuromuscular control.

### Lower Extremity Progressions and Neuromusculoskeletal Control

+ Neuromusculoskeletal control imbalances are often evident in clients during athletic movements that include ligament dominance, quadriceps dominance, and leg dominance 
  + Ligament dominance
    Decreased lower extremity frontal plane stability, usually evidenced by valgus and varus positioning, causing connective tissues to be the limiting factor of end range of motion control.
    + “Keep your knees in line with your second and third toes of your feet.”
  + Quadriceps (Knee) dominance
    Decreased strength or recruitment of the posterior chain musculature relative to anterior chain musculature.
    + “Bend your knees and hips as you land.”
    + “Keep your knees in line with your second and third toes.”
    + "Soft landing/feet.”
    + “Absorb your landing with your hips.”
  + Leg dominance
    Limb-to-limb asymmetries in neuromusculoskeletal control or muscle recruitment.
    + “Maintain equal weight on both legs as you land.”
    + “Have your feet touch down softly at the same time when landing.”
+ Ligament dominance deficits
  + instruct the individual to visualize and guide the knee as a single-plane (sagittal) hinge joint allowing flexion and extension, not valgus (medial displacement) and varus (lateral displacement) motion 
  + use training movements that will facilitate both identification and correction of unwanted knee motions in the frontal plane.
  + adequate feedback of correct technical performance

#### Athletic position

+ knees comfortably flexed, shoulders back, eyes up, feet approximately shoulder-width apart, and the body mass balanced over the balls of the feet. The knees should be over the balls of the feet and the chest should be over the knees 
+ functional starting and finishing position for most jumping tasks required during athletic performance



#### wall jumps

+ does not go through deep knee flexion angles, with most of the vertical movement provided by active ankle plantar flexion
+ Neuromusculoskeletal control of medial knee motion is critical when landing with knee angles close to full extension as this is a commonly reported mechanism of injury

#### Tuck Jump

+ requires a high effort level from the individual.

+ quickly identify an individual who may demonstrate abnormal levels of frontal plane knee displacement during jumping and landing because the individual usually devotes minimal attention to technique on the first few repetitions

#### horizontal jump test exercise 

![image-20211023054121624](6-Integration Techniques.assets/image-20211023054121624.png)

+ (also called a long jump with a double-leg stance) 
+ sagittal plane
+ active valgus: “dynamic valgus,” (when taking off from a jump rather than landing.) a position of hip adduction, tibial external rotation, and ankle eversion that is the result of muscular actions rather than ground reaction forces
+ moderate-intensity integrated, dynamic movement
+ hold the landing (stabilize) for 5 seconds: 
  +  The prolonged deep hold may facilitate feedback-driven lower extremity alignment adjustments and ultimately improve frontal plane alignment of the knee.

#### 180-degree jump

+ rotating in the transverse plane

#### single-leg hop and hold exercise

+ After individual has been trained to maintain appropriate knee alignment during the jump, land, and hold of the long-jump exercise with double-leg stance
+ Beginner: jump only a few inches and land with deep knee flexion
+ ACL injury risk reduction



#### Cutting manuvers

![image-20211023061137311](6-Integration Techniques.assets/image-20211023061137311.png)

+ end stages of training targeted toward ligament-dominance deficits
+ unanticipated cutting
+ Training programs that incorporate safe levels of lateral control may induce more muscle-dominant neuromusculoskeletal adaptations.
+ training that incorporates unanticipated movements can reduce lower-extremity injury risk.
+ training individuals to preactivate their musculature before landing may facilitate kinematic adjustments 
  + Kinematic adjustments
    Small alterations in movement pattern execution made in response to repetitive or novel performance conditions.
+ impart technique adaptations that will integrate into the client’s competitive movements during sport competition or during daily living activities.
