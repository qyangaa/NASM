# Knee

## Introduction

+ Status
  + Injuries involving the lower extremity account for more than 66% of all injuries
  + knee is susceptible to injuries resulting from lower kinetic chain impairments
  + 5 to 24 years of age had the highest injury rate. Knee injuries were reported to account for 60% of high school sports–related surgeries, and female athletes were reported to be four to six times more likely to sustain a major knee injury.
+ Common injuries
  + anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Over 70% of ACL ruptures occur during single-foot contact in physical activity secondary to uncontrolled lower extremity biomechanics 
  + Patellar tendinopathy
    Often associated with jumper’s knee; commonly an overuse injury affecting the patellar tendon, resulting in anterior knee pain.
  + Patellofemoral pain syndrome
    A musculoskeletal condition in which a client experiences pain behind and around the patella with running, squatting, jumping, or other physical activity.
  + Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome
    Often associated with runner’s knee; usually an overuse injury where the iliotibial band rubs on the femur, resulting in lateral knee pain.

### Functional Anatomy

#### Bones and Joints

+ tibiofemoral joint

  + Screw-home mechanism

    External tibial rotation on the femur in open-chain exercises and femoral internal rotation in closed-chain exercises, resulting in the knee “locking-out.”

  + opan chain: as the knee extends during the last 30 degrees, the tibia will externally rotate on the femur to lock the knee into extension, making the ligaments taut

  + Closed-chain: femur will internally rotate on the tibia (Kim et al., 2015), given that the foot is fixated on the ground.

+ patellofemoral joint + quadriceps muscle group

  + Extensor mechanism (aids knee extension)
    Composed of the patellofemoral articulation, patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, and tibial tubercle working together to produce concentric, eccentric, and isometric actions at the knee.
  + As the quadricep muscles join superiorly, they pass over the patella, forming the patellar tendon, This region is highly susceptible to overuse injuries. As individuals squat, jump, land, run, and walk, the quadricep muscles eccentrically contract, increasing the amount pressure and pull on the patellofemoral articulation

+ fibula: attachment site of the biceps femoris, which crosses and affects the knee.

![image-20211023102057297](12-knee.assets/image-20211023102057297.png)

+ Primarily flexion and extension, 
  + possible: internal and external rotation; valgus and varus; and rolling, sliding, and spinning, when improperly stabilized these motions become more prominent and can lead to injury. 

#### Muscles

+ Key muscles
  + Adductor complex
  + Gastrocnemius/soleus
  + Gluteus maximus and medius
  + Medial and lateral hamstrings complexes
  + Quadriceps
  + Tensor fascia latae (TFL)/IT-band

+ weakness of the hip external ro-tators and gluteus medius and maximus could cause overactivation of the tensor fascia latae (TFL), adductor complex, vastus lateralis, and gastrocnemius muscles.
+ synergistically dominan TFL and adductors become, ultimately resulting in the femur internally rotating and the tibia externally rotating, creating a knee valgus compensation.
+ oevractive vastus lateralis, given its lateral orientation and attachment to the patella, will cause the patella to track laterally and delay the activation of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) a
+ overactive gastrocnemius, due to tibial external rotation



### Altered Knee Movement

+ Multidirectional forces
  + ACL sprains or tears
  + patellofemoral joint pain (PFP)
+ Most knee injuries occur during noncontact deceleration in the frontal and transverse planes.

+ Static Malalignments
  + pes planus distortion syndrome,  10-degree shift in Q-angle increased patellofemoral contact forces by 45% 
  + excessive anterior pelvic tilt; and decreased flexibility of the quadriceps, hamstrings complex, and iliotibial band

+ Abnormal Muscle Activation Patterns
  + individuals with decreased hip external rotation strength have increased vertical ground reaction forces during landing, which is a potential predictor of PFP and ACL injury 
  + increased adductor activity and decreased dorsiflexion in subjects demonstrating increased dynamic knee valgus and decreased neuromuscular control of core musculature
+ Dynamic Malalignment
  + during movement as a result of poor neuromuscular control and dynamic stability of the trunk and lower extremities
  + contralateral pelvic drop, femoral adduction and internal rotation, tibial external rotation, and excessive foot and ankle pronation.





## Assessment

### IR model

+ Superiorly, the hip joint, a ball-and-socket joint, requires a great amount of mobility and stability (Sueki et al., 2013). The hinged knee joint, located in the middle of two highly mobile joints, requires relatively less multiplanar mobility and stability
+ PFP syndrome has been associated with muscular weakness in the LPHC, specifically the hip abductors and lateral rotators
+ knee valgus: foot overpronates, the foot externally rotates and/or everts during movement, and tibial external rotation, femoral adduction, and hip internal rotation increase
+ knee varus if the foot oversupinates, this may lead to a tightness of the lateral gastrocnemius/soleus complex, creating tibial external rotation caused by tightness of the biceps femoris, weakness of the adductor musculature, and tightness of the piriformis

![image-20211023105557390](12-knee.assets/image-20211023105557390.png)

+ Transitional assessment
  + wearing dress shoes and spending long hours in seated positions—knee valgus will be the typical movement impairment seen at the knee.
  + elevated heels improve the alignment of the knee during the OHSA, then the root cause of the impairment is likely due to the lack of ankle dorsiflexion. , if elevating the heels does not improve the squat, then musculature at the hips may be involved in the impairments, such as overactive adductors and underactive gluteals
+ Dynamic movement 
  + Depth-jump: 
    + Anterior view to identify knee position on ground strike and throughout the eccentric phase of landing.
    + Most impairments will be observed during deceleration.
    + Knee valgus/ knee dominance
  + If client already has adequate transitional movement, Many times compensations seen during the depth jump may reflect underactivity in the muscles, such as the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and core stabilizers. 
  + Gait analysis
    + If an individual is not ready to perform the depth jump assessment, but still has goals related to dynamic activities (e.g., obstacle course race), a basic gait analysis 
    + anterior viewpoint to see if their knee tracks medially (valgus) or laterally (varus) in the frontal plane.
+ Mobility
  + Overactivity in the hip flexors (modified Thomas test), quadriceps (modified Thomas test, active knee flexion test), hamstrings (active knee extension test), adductors (hip abduction and external rotation test), and abductors (modified Thomas test) can be assessed.
  + overactivity in hip external rotators (passive hip internal rotation, seated hip internal rotation), hip internal rotators (seated hip external rotation), and gastrocnemius/soleus (weight-bearing lunge test) may be confirmed using mobility assessments.

### Knee Valgus

+ Inhibit: gastrocnemius/soleus, adductor complex, TFL, and lateral thigh (emphasizing the vastus lateralis and/or short head of the biceps femoris).
+ Lengthen: gastroc-nemius/soleus, adductor complex, TFL, and biceps femoris.
+ Activate:
  + LPHC: gluteus medius and gluteus maximus
  + Ankle: anterior and posterior tibialis
+ Integrate: 
  + no change in the base of support, as with a supported squat (e.g., ball squat with an elastic mini-band around the knees),
  +  and then progress to more dynamic exercises, such as movement with a change in the base of support (e.g., a lateral tube walk, to a step-up to balance, to a lunge to balance, to a single-leg squat). 
  + Further, integration exercises can be progressed to include increased rate of concentric force production and eccentric deceleration control with the inclusion of wall jumps, tuck jumps, 180-degree jumps, single-leg hops, and cutting maneuvers.
  + Supported squat with mini-band around knees
    Wall jump



### Knee Varus

+ Inhibit: adductor magnus, piriformis, TFL, and biceps femoris (long head).
+ Lengthen: adductor magnus, piriformis, TFL, and biceps femoris (long head).
+ Activate
  + LPHC: adductor complex, medial hamstrings, and gluteus maximus.abdominal core exercises 
  + While it is counterintuitive that a hip external rotator (gluteus maximus) requires activation with a varus impairment, it is more likely that the gluteus maximus is underactive with a synergistically dominant piriformis in this situation. 
+ Integrate: same with valgus
  + squeeze (i.e., activate the adductors) to hold the ball in position, thus improving overall knee alignment.
  + Supported squat with medicine ball between knees
    Wall jump



### Knee Dominance

+ Focus on the piriformis/adductor magnus versus quadriceps/soleus contribution will be determined by the corrective exercise assessment flow. 
  + accompanied by a heel rise, the corrective exercise program can focus on the quadriceps/soleus. 
  + LPHC impairment is present, the corrective exercise program for knee dominance can focus on the piriformis/adductor magnus combination.

+ Inhibit: quadriceps and soleus and/or piriformis and adductor magnus.
+ Lengthen: quadriceps, soleus, piriformis, and adductor magnus.
+ Activate: gluteus maximus and core stabilizers
+ Integrate: same as valgus
  + no need to emphasize abductors or adductors
  + encourage optimal alignment of the knee and coordinated movement with the hip and foot and ankle complex 
  + Squat pattern
    Wall jump



## Common issues

### Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper’s Knee)

+ ![image-20211023112624932](12-knee.assets/image-20211023112624932.png)

+ patellar tendon, originating on the base of the patella and inserting at the tibial tuberosity

+ provides the forces necessary to extend the knee in an open-chain position

+ Symptom

  + a common overuse injury and is characterized as pain at the base of the patella
  + In OHSA: Pain on or around the patellar tendon, need to modify or stop the assessment if knee pain is present
  + pes planus distortion syndrome 

+ individuals with underactive gluteals may develop overactive quadriceps in an attempt to compensate for a loss of extensor force production (Mills et al., 2015). The increased activity of the quadriceps may add to the already cumulative forces being distributed through the patellar tendon.

+ Risk factors:

  + Knee valgus and varus
  + An increased Q-angle
  + Poor quadriceps and hamstrings complex flexibility
  + Poor eccentric deceleration capabilities
  + Overtraining and playing on hard surfaces (Everhart et al., 2017; Malliaras et al., 2015)

  

### Patellofemoral Syndrome (PFS)

+ Cause: abnormal tracking of the patella within the femoral trochlea or patellar groove. attributable to static (i.e., increased Q-angle) or dynamic lower extremity malalignment (i.e., increased femoral internal rotation, adduction, and knee valgus), altered muscle activation of surrounding knee musculature, decreased strength of the hip musculature
  ![image-20211023113826936](12-knee.assets/image-20211023113826936.png)
+ Symptoms 
  + pes planus distortion syndrome
  + excessive pronation, or heel rise. 
  + The SLSA will result in knee valgus or varus.
  + Pain will be associated on the front aspect of the knee behind the patella. 

### Iliotibial Band (IT-Band) Syndrome (Runner’s Knee)

+ Cause
  + inflammation and irritation of the distal portion of the iliotibial tendon as it rubs against the lateral femoral condyle as well as compresses the fat pad underneath it, or less commonly, the greater trochanter of the hip, causing a greater trochanteric bursitis
  + lack of flexibility of the TFL, which can result in an increase in tension on the IT-band during the stance phase of running.
  + caused by overuse
  + Weakness in the hip abductor muscles, such as the gluteus medius, may result in synergistic dominance of the TFL (increasing frontal plane instability
  + may lead to increased tension of the IT-band, and thus increased friction on the tissue, with inflammation being the end result.
    <img src="12-knee.assets/image-20211023114507486.png" alt="image-20211023114507486" style="zoom:50%;" />
+ Symptoms
  + injury is most often reported in runners as a result of abnormal gait or running biomechanics,
  + knee valgus during the OHSA and SLSA or pes planus distortion syndrome may be more prone to IT-band irritability.

### Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Injury

+ Cause
  + Many ACL injuries occur from indirect contact (such as changing direction and cutting) due to altered lower extremity neuromusculoskeletal control and the action of anterior forces, lateral forces, rotational forces, or a combination of all three forces on the knee
  + Proximal neuromusculoskeletal control deficits at the hip and trunk during landing are also potential contributing mechanisms
  + can be reduced from 51% to 62% through the application of educational interventions and targeted neuromuscular training
    + should focus on improving movement impairment, such as excessive knee valgus, knee rotation, hip adduction, and hip rotation; improving single-leg neuromuscular balance; and improving muscle strength

### Prehabilitation & rehabilitation

+ Prehabilitation: pre-surgery
  + reduce swelling, increase range of motion, and maintain strength in the lower extremity.
  + targeted inhibitory, lengthening, activation, and integration exercises for the foot and ankle complex and the LPHC.
+ Post surgical
  + limited range of motion secondary to pain and swelling and a loss of muscular strength and tone, especially in the quadriceps muscle group of the involved leg
