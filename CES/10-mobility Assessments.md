# Introduction

+ Mobility
  The entire available range of motion at a joint and the body’s neuromuscular control of that motion.
  + mobility depends on soft tissue extensibility entire available range of motion at a joint as well as the body’s neuromuscular control during motion (i.e., muscle length and state of neural activation). 
+ Flexibility
  The present state or ability of a joint to move through a range of motion.
+ Factors affecting normal mobility include posture, pattern overload movements (e.g., computer work and repetitive lifting), joint structure, age, pain, injury, gender, and psychosocial influences

## The Mobility Assessment

+  Answers questions: 
  + do overactive/shortened or underactive/lengthened muscles contribute more to the observed movement impairment?
  + Among the overactive/shortened muscles listed, are there specific ones that play a more prominent role in the movement impairment?
  + Is the corrective exercise program improving the mobility of the client or athlete over time?
+ examples
  + if a movement impairment is observed during static and movement assessment stages, but mobility assessments do not show a flexibility (ROM) limitation at the relevant kinetic chain checkpoint, then it is more likely that poor neuromuscular control and underactive/lengthened muscles are the potential culprit
+ **Ensuring Reliability**
  consistent with every client

## The Scientific Rationale for Mobility Testing

+ Flexibility deficits 

  + caused by shortened contractile tissue (i.e., skeletal muscle) and changes in noncontractile tissue (e.g., tendons, ligaments)
  + risk factors: metabolic factors, psychological factors (e.g., limbic system overactivity), preexisting injury, neuromuscular factors, and myofascial dysfunction (e.g., trigger points).

+ combination of **active** and **passive motions**

  Active motion

  The amount of motion obtained solely through voluntary contraction. 

  Passive motion

  The amount of motion observed without any assistance from an external force.

+ Full, pain-free motion is considered normal mobility. Restricted motion is considered a mobility issue, which may be caused by a flexibility deficit. Shortened (overactive) muscles and soft tissues are a common cause of decreased flexibility, which can affect mobility.

### UPPER BODY MOBILITY TESTING

+  Head
  + Shortened cervical extensors, flexors, and rotators 
+ shoulder girdle and glenohumeral joint
  + shortened pectoralis major and minor and latissimus dorsi often contribute to impairments during the overhead squat assessment (OHSA). The client may demonstrate an excessive anterior pelvic tilt and arms falling forward. 
  + A shortened pectoralis minor can often be found in Janda’s upper crossed syndrome and can be assessed with scapular retraction 
  + Decreased latissimus dorsi flexibility can be assessed with shoulder flexion (lat length test). 
  + Flexibility tests for the pectorals and latissimus dorsi have been shown to be reliable when conducted by one professional observing or using a tape measure or goniometer
  + Decreased glenohumeral internal and external rotation can also contribute to the arms falling forward during the OHSA or may limit upper extremity motions during basic functional activities (e.g., lifting a box above the head or throwing a ball). 

+ elbow, forearm, and wrist, 
  + Shortening of the elbow and wrist flexors and extensors

### LOWER BODY MOBILITY TESTING

+ LPHC, 
  + iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and tensor fascia latae (TFL)/IT band complex, flexibility can be tested with supine hip and knee extension (modified Thomas test). pass–fail criteria 
  + Hip adductor (adductor magnus, adductor brevis, adductor longus, gracilis, and pectineus) flexibility can be tested using hip abduction and external rotation (adductor flexibility test). 

+ knee joint,
  + quadriceps can be tested using prone knee flexion (Duncan-Ely test).  pass–fail criteria or using a goniometer to measure joint ROM 
  + Hamstring flexibility can also be tested using the active knee extension test (AKE)
+ ankle joint, 
  + gastrocnemius and soleus can be tested with weight- bearing ankle dorsiflexion (weight-bearing lunge test)

## Foot and Ankle Screening

+ feet turning out, excessive pronation, knee valgus, or excessive forward trunk lean during the OHSA 
+  begin by testing ankle dorsiflexion and then move to testing extension of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.

### Ankle Dorsiflexion

<img src="10-mobility Assessments.assets/image-20211024082035600.png" alt="image-20211024082035600" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Client position**: Standing in a lunge position with shoes off, feet straight, and heels planted firmly on the ground and toes positioned approximately 2 inches away from the wall

**Type of motion**: Passive (forward test leg is relaxed)

**Target motions**: The client’s front leg (test leg) lunges toward the wall, using hands for support, until the ankle and foot reach their end-range. The back foot is positioned to support the overall posture.

**Veral instructions**: “Keep your front foot straight and heel planted firmly on the ground, then lunge forward until the first stretch sensation is felt in the back of your front leg. Avoid pushing with your back leg/foot.”

**Assessment**:

- **Normal mobility**: The client is able to touch the wall with the forward-bending knee without compensation.

- Restricted dorsiflexion

  : The client is unable to touch the wall or displays compensations such as heel lift, foot external rotation, arch collapse, or knee valgus.

  - **Overactive/shortened**: Gastrocnemius and soleus

### First MTP (Great Toe) Extension

+ important part of normal walking and running. During the running or walking gait cycle, individuals will push off through the toes to propel themselves forward. Normal first MTP extension during push off tightens the plantar fascia, creating a more rigid lever, which is called the windlass mechanism (Caravaggi et al., 2009). This mechanism helps the foot to generate greater force to propel the body forward. 
+ A lack of first MTP mobility can lead to compensations and possible injury through the lower kinetic chain and LPHC may lead to compensation during movements that require pivoting, lunging, or lower extremity rotation.

### HIP COMPLEX

+ modified Thomas test is particularly useful in determining which muscle is the primary limiter of hip extension in a client (i.e., which one(s) would be overactive/shortened). 
+ Some assessments, such as shoulder flexion, may be performed while standing. Other assessments, such as knee flexion/extension or passive internal rotation, can just as easily done on an exercise mat on the floor. For assessments like the modified Thomas test, try placing two plyometric boxes or benches together to create a level, raised surface.

**Type of motion**: Active

**Target motions**: The client squeezes the ball or roller between the knees to lock the hips in place and the client maintains a neutral cervical spine. The client then rotates the upper body to each side as far as possible.

**Verbal instruction**: “Hold the stick to your chest under crossed arms. Squeeze the roller between the knees, look forward, and keep your nose in line with the sternum. Rotate your trunk to the right as far as you can. Then, rotate to the left.”

**Assessment**:

- **Normal mobility**: The sternum (or stick) **rotates roughly 45 degrees** from the starting position to each side without compensation.

- Restricted thoracic rotation

  : The client is unable to reach the target mobility benchmark or displays compensations such as lateral flexion of the spine, leaning forward or backward, and shoulder protraction.

  - **Overactive/shortened**: Rectus abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique, and erector spinae on the side opposite of the restriction.
