## Introduction

+ Goal: improving available ROM at a joint, increasing tissue extensibility, decreasing muscle and tendon injury risk, and enhancing neuromuscular efficiency)

+ Flexibility vs stretching
  + Flexibility
    The present state or ability of a joint to move through a range of motion.
  + Stretching
    An active process to elongate muscles and connective tissues in order to increase the present state of flexibility.
+ Women more flexible then man
  +  differences in muscle mass, joint geometry, and the degree of collagen protein in the musculotendinous unit
  + more flexible during pregnancy due to release of hormones such as relaxin
  + the greater joint laxity of women and the greater potential for joint injuries.



### Types of stretching

+ Static stretching
  The process of passively taking a muscle to the point of tension and holding the stretch for a minimum of 30 seconds.
  + Static stretching combines low-to-moderate forces with long duration using a variety of neural, mechanical, and psycho-physiological mechanisms. This form of stretching, performed alone or with a partner, allows for relaxation and concomitant elongation of muscle. To properly perform static stretching, the stretch is held at the first point of tension or resistance barrier for a specific time period (e.g., 30 seconds). It is theorized that this form of flexibility decreases muscle spindle activity and motor neuron excitability (neural), muscle compliance and changes in fascicle angles and orientation (mechanical), and increased stretch tolerance (psycho-physiological).
+ Dynamic stretching
  The active extension of a muscle, using a muscle’s force production and the body’s momentum, to take a joint through the full available range of motion
  + Dynamic stretching uses a controlled movement through the full or nearly full joint ROM.
+ Neuromuscular stretching (NMS)
  A flexibility technique that incorporates varied combinations of isometric contraction and static stretching of the target muscle to create increases in range of motion. Also called proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF).
  + Neuromuscular stretching (NMS; commonly called proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, or PNF) involves taking the muscle to its end-ROM (point of joint compensation), holding that position for 10 to 30 seconds, and then actively contracting the stretched muscle for 5 to 10 seconds. NMS often needs a partner but can be performed with stretch bands..
+ Active stretching
  + Active stretching uses multiple repetitions of a 2-second static stretch but emphasizes a contraction of the antagonist to induce reciprocal inhibition. This intervention is used to move
    muscles that tend to be overactive through available ranges of motion and to prepare them for work.
+ Ballistic stretching
  + Ballistic stretching is also dynamic, but it differs from dynamic stretching in that ballistic stretching incorporates higher-speed movements with bouncing actions at the end of the ROM. Due to the higher movement velocities and less control of the movement with ballistic stretching, it is riskier and carries a greater chance for injury, especially when a proper active warm-up is not incorporated beforehand. It is not considered a part of the corrective exercise strategy. It is used by competitive athletes in a warm-up in an attempt to activate the central nervous system and muscle.

### Static stretching

+ Characteristics
  + Elongation of muscle and myofascial tissue to an end-range and statically holding that position for a period of time
  + Maximal control of structural alignment
  + Minimal acceleration into and out of the elongated (stretch) position
  + lowest risk for injury during the stretching routine and deemed the safest to use because individuals can perform static stretching on their own with the slow, minimal-to-no motion required
  + commonly performed alone, so it can be easily incorporated into any integrated exercise program
+ Mechanical adaptations
  + affect the viscoelastic component of myofascial tissue
    + Viscoelastic
      The collective properties related to fluid flow, heat dissipation, and elasticity of tissue.
  + decrease in the passive resistance a muscle has to stretching, which allows greater tissue extensibility
  + causes an acute viscoelastic stress relaxation response, allowing for an immediate increase in ROM
+ Neurological adaptation 
  + decrease motor neuron excitability.
  + muscle spindle,
    + nuclear chain fibers preferentially respond to changes in muscle elongation,
    + nuclear bag fibers respond to both the extent and rate of elongation
    + when the static stretch is held for a prolonged period (e.g., 30 to 60 seconds), these reflexes are less active (disfacilitation), and thus the muscle can relax more
    + Even with less than a 10-second stretch, the nuclear bag fibers should decrease their discharge rate because there would be no change in the rate of the stretch.
  + Cutaneous (i.e., skin) nerve fibers, when activated by mechanical stress (e.g., tension, pressure, or vibration), can also contribute to an increase in ROM
    + help reduce muscle reflex activity (pre- and postsynaptic inhibition), but they only continue for a few seconds after stretching
    + provide a minor contribution during large-amplitude stretches
  + GTOs 
    + are activated by tension exerted on the muscle tendon (Chalmers, 2004; Houk et al., 1980), contributing to reflex inhibition (autogenic inhibition). 
    + However, it has been shown that GTOs are not highly sensitive to the tension associated with static stretching
    + more likely to occur with dynamic stretches that use large ranges of motion (Guissard & Duchateau, 2006) such as leg swings.
    + GTO inhibition stops around 60 to 100 milliseconds after stretching, so its effect would not persist after ending the stretch
    + GTOs are more active during active muscle contractions, their inhibition effect would contribute more during dynamic stretching than with a passive holding of a stretch.
  + Renshaw cells
    Interneurons that prevent excessive output of the central nervous system’s contraction reflex response to sudden changes in muscle length.
    + large-amplitude stretches (recurrent inhibition).
    + Recurrent inhibition plays a greater role with weak dynamic contractions
+ Psycho-physiological adaptations
  + stretch tolerance means the client or athlete can tolerate greater discomfort and then push themselves through a greater ROM
  + signal the release of endorphins and enkephalins (opioids made by the body) that will reduce pain and discomfort throughout the body
+ Chronic adaptations
  + muscle spindle discharge can be chronically reduced, leading to a more relaxed muscle
  + more compliant (i.e., less stiff) muscle that would cause less activation of the spindles.
  + decreases in muscle stiffness (increased compliance) are attributed to plastic (semi-permanent) changes in the muscle fiber angles, changes in the structure of tissue components (e.g., fewer collagen cross-linkages), and other factors.
  + Tissue creep
    An initial rapid increase in strain followed by a slower increase in strain at a constant stress.
    + muscles and tendons do not return to their original length after prolonged stretching because of physical changes in the proteins, such as collagen
  + stretch tolerance 

### Neuromuscular stretching

+ isometrically contracting a desired muscle in a lengthened position, reduced negative effect on muscular power than static stretching
+ 4 stages
  + Taking the target muscle to its end-range ROM (point of joint compensation) and holding for 10 seconds
  + Actively contracting the target muscle to be stretched (5- to 10-second submaximal intensity contraction)
  + Passively (or actively) elongating the target muscle to a new end-range
  + Statically holding the new position for 20 to 30 seconds and repeating the contract-relax cycle up to a total of three times
+ Variations
  + contract–relax method includes static stretching of the target muscle followed immediately by an isometric contraction of the stretched (target) muscle, followed with another stretch of the target muscle.
  + contract–relax–agonist–contract (CRAC) 
    + additional contraction of the agonist muscle (i.e., the muscle opposing the target muscle) immediately following the isometric contraction and prior to the additional stretching of the target muscle.
+ Advantage
  + more mechanical stress on the tendon than with passive static stretching
  + Because the muscle is already in an elongated position, the subsequent contraction will emphasize the elongation of the tendon (tissue creep), providing an additional mechanical factor (reduced tendon stiffness) not emphasized with static stretching and further helping to increase joint ROM
+ Mechanisms
  + activate the GTOs (autogenic inhibition) 
  + Autogenic inhibition
    The process by which neural impulses that sense tension are greater than the impulses that cause muscles to contract, providing an inhibitory effect to the muscle spindles.



### Dynamic Stretching

+ controlled movement through the entire ROM of the active joints (Fletcher, 2010): for example, single-leg squatting (Figure 4-5), multiplanar sequences (Figure 4-6), or moving the arms in circles (shoulder circumduction (Figure 4-7).
+ increase metabolic activity, elevating muscle temperature, improved muscle viscoelasticity
+  improve, or at least has no detrimental effects on, subsequent performance in comparison to the reports regarding prolonged static stretching or NMS performed in isolation without a full warm-up.
+ dynamic stretching excites the central nervous system. The higher rate and amount of muscle lengthening with dynamic stretching increases myotatic reflex activity, and thus counterbalances the inhibitory effects of static stretching on subsequent performance.
+ Inhibiting muscle activation of overactive tissues is a key component of the Corrective Exercise Continuum. **Thus, static stretching and/or NMS should be used prior to activity when muscle imbalances are present.**

## Scientific Rationale for stretching

![image-20211022131140941](4-Lengthening Techniques.assets/image-20211022131140941.png)

+ Although tissue compliance will not change the total or absolute force applied to muscles and tendons, it will influence how those forces are distributed over time. With a more compliant (i.e., more flexible) musculotendinous unit, muscles and tendons will absorb forces over a longer duration, reducing the peak forces applied to them

Traditional theory opposing static stretching pre-exercise

![image-20211022131934841](4-Lengthening Techniques.assets/image-20211022131934841.png)

### Current Research supports pre-exercise stretching

#### Suggested warm-up components

+ Myofascial Rolling

  + 90 seconds to 2 minutes of myofascial rolling per muscle group to increase muscle temperatures, decrease tissue viscoelasticity, increase inhibition, and other factors.

+ Static Stretching

  + < 60 seconds per muscle group if participating in high-intensity exercise or athletic activity.

    No need to go to the point of discomfort or pain.

    Stretch major muscle groups and specific muscle groups to the activity. Focus on muscles identified as overactive/shortened during assessment stages.

+ Dynamic Stretching

  + ≤ 90 seconds per muscle group.

    Use full range of motion with a controlled movement at moderate speeds.

+ Task-Specific Activities

  + 5 to 15 minutes.

    Practice movements that are associated with the sport or task at velocities close to the actual movement. This may include exercises performed during the Activate and Integrate phases of the Corrective Exercise Continuum.

#### Psychological benefits of stretching

+ results in decreased feelings of sadness, and can decrease levels of stress-related hormones 
+ greater participant confidence regarding their performance in the ensuing sports-related tests. 



#### Improve ROM

+ it cannot be conclusively stated that one stretching technique is definitively better than the others for improving joint ROM.
+  degree of improvement may be relative to the total available ROM at the joint
+ each joint and muscle group may respond differently to stretching protocols
+  it is possible for overtraining to occur with excessive stretching frequencies, which may be reflected in the lack of increases in static ROM
+ Intensity: should approach their point of discomfort momentarily and then reduce that elongation by about 10%
  + elastic limit is the minimum amount of stress placed on tissue to elicit permanent strain. Going farther than the elastic limit could cause the tissue to not return to its original length (Alter, 2004), and thus contribute to strains (muscle) and sprains (ligaments).
  + Stretching an injured or fatigued muscle or tendon to the point of discomfort can lead to additional injury!
  + to the point of discomfort (high force) or not (low force): 
    + High-force, shorter-duration: emphasize elastic (short-term) tissue deformation. Low-force, longer-duration, plastic (long-term)
+ Duration: With the variation of research results from different lengthening technique protocols, it is important for the Corrective Exercise Specialist to find the right combination of techniques and training variables for each client that maximizes adherence and effectiveness. 
+ RI model
  + stretching tight ipsilateral quadriceps and hip flexor musculature would affect hip flexion ROM

#### Atheletic performance

+ acutely, prolonged static or NMS stretching may have a detrimental effect on muscular strength, power, balance, reaction and movement time, as well as vertical jump height and sprint speed
+ static stretching should be performed for less than 60 seconds per muscle prior to higher intensity athletic endeavors, whereas dynamic and ballistic stretching do not have the same effect 
+ comprehensive warm-up that includes static stretching followed by additional movements to activate the nervous system (such as in phases 3 and 4 of the Corrective Exercise Continuum) will prevent any negative effect on performance.
+ Problem with previous studies
  + lack of real-life application
  + primarily in individuals who do not have any functional ROM limitations
  + The few studies that involve a full warm-up do not report performance decrements and show that stretching may even provide some performance improvements

+ Stretching can enhance muscle and tendon compliance (less stiffness), which augments the stretch–shortening cycle (i.e., used in jumping, sprinting) by enhancing the ability to store elastic energy
  + This enhancement is more apparent with longer-duration eccentric (muscle lengthening) to concentric (muscle shortening) contractions, such as a rebound chest press (Wilson et al., 1992), but it might not have such a benefit on brief duration stretch–shortening cycle activities like sprinting.
+ greater force production at longer muscle lengths

#### Injury resistance

+ Stretching cannot decrease the incidence of all-cause injuries (e.g., concussions, fractured bones, etc.). However, static stretching can reduce the incidence of muscle and tendon injuries, especially with high-velocity and change-of-direction activities, as is common in athletics or higher-intensity exercise.

### Summary of evidences

+ There is strong evidence to indicate that regular stretching of all types (static, NMS, or dynamic) improves ROM.
+ There is a moderate level of evidence that dynamic stretch training can positively affect strength and performance, whereas static stretching can decrease muscle and tendon injury risk in healthy individuals without identified limitations in flexibility.
+ There is moderate evidence to indicate that acute, prolonged (> 60 seconds per muscle group), pre-exercise static stretching and NMS performed in isolation (i.e., without a complete warm-up sequence) can decrease strength and performance by 3–7%. However, when placed within the context of a comprehensive warm-up and/or the phases of the Corrective Exercise Continuum, static stretching and NMS will have a trivial chance of impairing subsequent performance and do not increase injury risk in healthy individuals without identified limitations in flexibility.



#### Limitation in researches

+ Research was not performed on individuals with limited flexibility.
  - Pre-exercise stretching may have positive effects on performance and injury risk in those who are inflexible at the outset.
+ Research focused primarily on stretching as the sole exercise.
  - Flexibility is only one piece to maximizing performance and decreasing injury risk.
  - Much of the research investigated impractical (lack of ecological validity) durations of stretching.
  - An integrated continuum may have different results: Inhibit → Stretch (Lengthen) → Activate → Integrate into Functional Movement
+ Research has not addressed an individual’s specific needs based on an assessment.
  - Research has taken a one-size-fits-all approach.
  - Research needs to investigate the effects of pre-exercise stretching on inflexible muscle groups.
+ A customized corrective exercise strategy may be most effective in improving performance and decreasing the risk of injury.
