# Introduction

+ Benefit: 
  + rapport: The backbone for the entire corrective exercise process is to first build strong rapport with clients.
  + motivation, encouragement
+ Communication
  + empathy: create trust and understanding, reinforce adherence
  + explanation of assessments 
  + Examples
    + posture-improving program will help them achieve their goals in the safest and most effective manner possible. done by addressing movement efficiency and recruiting the proper muscles at the proper time
    + decreases the chances the client will overtrain and lays the groundwork for optimal progression through the NASM Optimum Performance Training® (OPT®) model.
+ Steps (static > movement > mobility)
  + Client intake screen: subjective information
    + any “red flags” related to physical readiness, general lifestyle, and medical history.
    + potential movement impairments that may come to light later in the assessment process.
  + Static postural assessment: standing still
    + Proper **static posture** (The starting point from which an individual moves) allows for optimal mobility and joint kinematics
    + poor posture is indicative of either a structural problem or poor musculoskeletal recruitment patterns.
  + Movement assessments: transitional and dynamic
    + **dynamic posture**, structural alignment of the musculoskeletal system when the body is in motion. 
    + **Compensatory movement** : A nonideal movement strategy employed by the kinetic chain to fulfill the desired movement pattern.
    + e.g. overhead squad -> single leg squat/ split squat -> dynamic/ loaded assessment
  + Mobility assessments: join ROM, refine previous observations
    + Human movement requires a combination of soft-tissue flexibility, joint range of motion, and neuromuscular control.
    + pinpoint muscles who need inhibition (phase 1), lengthening (phase 2), and activation (phase 3)
+ Caution:
  + When movement compensations are obvious in these early stage assessments, performing more-advanced tests may bring increased risk
  + biometric screening tools obtain data on the employee’s height, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, and fitness testing in some instances. 

# Client Intake Screen

+ Characteristics

  + most critical step for earning client buy-in and developing a long-term, profitable relationship.
  + build strong rapport
  + can be turned into a comprehensive questionnaire and can be completed prior to the client’s first visit or in person during the first meeting

  

### Components

#### Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), 

+ Series of questions designed to determine if a person is ready to undertake more strenuous physical activity.
+ possible cardiorespiratory dysfunction
+ If the client answers yes to any of the questions on the PAR-Q+, they need to be referred to a qualified medical professional for clearance prior to beginning their exercise regimen.
+ 7 questions: heart condition, pain in chest, dizziness, other chronical conditions, prescribed medications, bone joint soft tissue problem … 



#### general lifestyle (e.g., occupation, hobbies, etc.)

+ Occupation
  + client’s movement capacity and the kinds of movement patterns that are repeatedly performed throughout the day.
  + long sitting: musculoskeletal adaptations such as a decrease in spinal posture and increase in musculoskeletal discomfort
  + Repetitive movements: pattern overload to muscles and joints, which may lead to tissue trauma resulting in pain and eventually kinetic chain dysfunction. e.g. athletics
  + Dress shoes: ankle complex in a plantar flexed, tightness in the gastrocnemius and soleus causing movement impairments at the ankle, knee, and hip, such as overpronation of the feet during gait or an excessive forward lean when squatting
  + heavy lifting: low back injuries, If workers are not physically prepared for this repetitive load, they will compensate through synergistic dominance
  + occupational stress: 61% of Americans experience work-related stress
+ Lifestyle
  + Two of the most common outcomes from a mentally stressful life are anxiety and depression
  + Depression:  hunched posture
  + Anxiety: Breathing pattern dysfunction (BPD), A collection of suboptimal breathing patterns that can cause overactivity of accessory breathing muscles (e.g. scalene).
+ Sleep
  + Adults 8-9 hrs, adolescents 8-10 hrs
  + lack of sleep:
    +  fatigue and burnout, then
    + poor posture, such as slouching, defined as forward rolled shoulders, rounded upper back, and a forward head.
+ Nutrition and hydration
  + Adequately hydrated: color of light lemonade or clean urine color
  + Ad libidum
    Latin phrase that translates to “as desired”; refers to eating or drinking as you are normally driven to (i.e., not purposely overeating or undereating).
  + inadequate hydration: decrease in performance and overall health, creating fatigue and potentially further compensatory movement.
+ Recreation
  + golfers: LPHC, shoulder
  + alphine skiers: knee valgus, ankle knee LPHC compensations
  + tennis athletes: upper extremity, elbow and shoulder
+ Hobbies
  + Gardening, working on cars: hands, knees
  + sedentary: head forward, rounded shoulders, upper back rounded

#### medical history

##### Past Injury

One of the best predictors for the occurrence of future injuries is having been injured in the past.

+ Ankle sprains

  + decrease the neural control to the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus muscles. 
  +  altered knee flexion on landing tasks. 
+ Knee injuries
  + decrease in the neural control to muscles that stabilize the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints. 
  + Noncontact knee injuries are often the result of ankle or hip dysfunctions.
+ Low-back injuries
  + reduced lumbar mobility, slower movement, and reduced proprioception 
  + impact on the kinetic chain as the entire spine works as a functional unit. 
  + cause limited mobility in the thoracic spine, resulting in shoulder and cervical pathologies
+ Shoulder injuries
  + altered neural control of the rotator cuff muscles, instability of the shoulder joint during functional activities. 
  + linked to reduced thoracic mobility 
  + alter throwing mechanics
+ Other injuries
  + repetitive hamstring complex strains,
  + groin strains, 
  + patellar tendinitis (jumper’s knee), 
  + plantar fasciitis (pain in the arch of the foot), 
  + posterior tibialis tendinitis (shin splints), 
  + biceps tendinitis (shoulder pain),
  +  headaches

##### Past surgery

+ Types
  + Foot and ankle surgery
  + Knee surgery: 
    +  total knee arthroplasty (i.e., knee replacement) experience significant postoperative muscular changes to both function and strength
  + Back surgery
  + Shoulder surgery
  + Cesarean section for birth (cutting through the abdominal wall to deliver a baby)
  + Appendectomy (cutting through the abdominal wall to remove the appendix)
+ Results
  + cause pain, inflammation, and psychological and physiological effects
  + musculoskeletal denervation, muscle atrophy, depression, stress, and decreased overall mobility
  + tissue trauma and inflammation, Muscle spasms (Involuntary contraction of muscles surrounding a joint that immobilizes it in response to an injury) occur to protect the inflamed area
  + To avoid the pain involved with muscle spasms, injured body segments are often immobilized externally, allowing the injured segment to better relax and heal. 
  + Tissue trauma -> inflammation -> muscle spasm -> adhesions -> altered neuromuscular control -> muscle imbalance -> circle back

#### Goal setting

- **S**—Specific: What does the client want to achieve? Consider who, what, where, when, why, and how.
- **M**—Measurable: How will the goal be measured? What are the criteria for goal completion?
- **A**—Attainable: Is the goal achievable by the individual? The effort, time, and costs re-quired for achieving the goal need to be considered.
- **R**—Realistic: Is the goal relevant to the individual’s lifestyle and fitness needs? Is it some-thing they can reasonably expect to be able to achieve?
- **T**—Timely: What is the timeframe the goal should be completed in? What is the target completion date?



## Ethical and Legal considerations

### Signs to refer out

+ Swelling

  + indicative of internal trauma

+ Acute pain
  + sharp (i.e., acute), specifically if the pain is located over a bony prominence, within a joint, or within the abdomen. This is especially true if the pain occurs after a traumatic event such as a fall or other direct impact.

+ When in doubt
  + under-stand their practice limits, develop a multidisciplinary network of professionals, and always “refer out when in doubt.” 
  + include medical physicians, chiropractors, athletic trainers, physical therapists, licensed massage therapists, and registered dietician nutritionists.
