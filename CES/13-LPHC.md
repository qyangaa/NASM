+ iliofemoral joint 
  ![image-20211023142123688](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023142123688.png)
  + femur attaches to the ilium
  + acetabulum is the socket in the ilium where the femoral head connects and helps to deepen the socket.
  + ball and socket
+ sacroiliac joint
  + sacrum is a triangular bone set between the left and right ilia, like a keystone.
  + Little movement occurs at this joint, which is classified as a diarthrodial joint
+ lumbosacral joint
  ![image-20211023142131880](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023142131880.png)
  + L5 to sacrum
  + huge compressive force, requires stability to support such forces.

### Muscles

- Abdominal core complex
- Adductor complex
- Erector spinae
- Gastrocnemius/soleus
- Gluteus maximus and medius
- Hamstrings complex
- Hip flexors (psoas, rectus femoris)
- Intrinsic core stabilizers
- Latissimus dorsi
- Tensor fascia latae (TFL)/IT-band

### Altered LPHC Movement

+ 5% of male gymnasts, 80% of weightlifters, 69% of wrestlers, 58% of soccer players, 50% of tennis players, 30% of golfers, and 60% to 80% of the general population were reported to have LBP 
+ Individuals who have LBP are significantly more likely to have additional low-back injuries, which can predispose the individual to future osteoarthritis and long-term disability. 
+ static malalignments (altered length-tension relationships or altered joint arthrokinematics), abnormal muscle activation patterns (altered force-couple relationships), and dynamic malalignments (movement system impairments) can lead to LBP

+ Static malalignments
  + low back excessively arches, low back rounds, or trunk excessively leans forward
  + activation and the relative moment arm of the muscle fibers decrease
  + Vertebral disc injuries occur when the outer fibrous structure of the disc (annulus fibrosis) fails, allowing the internal contents of the disc (nucleus pulposus) to be extruded and irritate nerves exiting the intervertebral foramen
+ Abnormal muscle activation patterns
  + Subjects with LBP demonstrate impaired postural control, delayed muscle relaxation, and abnormal muscle recruitment patterns
  + transverse abdominis and multifidus activation is diminished in patients with LBP
  + similar delay in activation of the internal oblique, multifidus, and gluteus maximus was observed on the symptomatic side of individuals with sacroiliac joint pain
  + multifidus atrophy was present in clients even in the absence of continued LBP
  + bilateral imbalance in isometric strength of the hip extensors was related to the development of LBP
+ Dynamic malalignment
  + increased valgus positioning of the lower extremity, increased risk of knee injuries

### IR Model

+ Above
  + common injuries are often seen in the cervical spine and cervicothoracic region 
  + ability to recruit shoulder musculature
  + anterior translation of the humeral head (<u>Joseph et al., 2014</u>)
  + elbow
  + Core stabilization training has shown to increase thickness of the diaphragm and improve LPHC stability 
+ Below
  + significant risk factor for lower extremity overuse injuries
  + Knee
    + patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee; Silva et al., 2015), iliotibial band (IT-band) tendinitis (runner’s knee; Mucha et al., 2017), patellofemoral pain syndrome (Foroughi et al., 2019), and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears 
    + ability to stabilize the LPHC has been shown to decrease hip flexion, adduction, and rotation while minimizing knee valgus and subtalar joint movement during dynamic single-leg landing mechanics 
    + voluntary recruitment of the transverse abdominis and internal obliques increased maximum voluntary contraction of the hip muscles during corrective hip strengthening exercises (Tsang et al., 2018). This suggests a coactivation of the deep abdominal musculature and hip musculature.
  + Foot and ankle
    + plantar fasciitis (McClinton et al., 2018), Achilles tendinopathy (Habets et al., 2017), and medial tibial stress syndrome

+ Static
  + ![image-20211023143843650](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023143843650.png)
  + Anterior tilt:
    + Lower crossed
    + layered crossed syndromes
    + Kendall’s lordotic
    + kyphosis-lordosis posture
    + pes planus distortion syndrome 
  + Posterior tilt
    + sway-back
    + flat-back postures 
    + Janda’s upper crossed syndrome, where rounding of the upper back can be responded to at the lumbar spine with increased flexion that visually flattens out the low back
+ Transitional
  + OHSA
    + anterior pelvic tilt may be linked with overactive/ shortened hip flexors and underactive abdominal muscles (**Figure 13-9**),
    +  posterior pelvic tilt (**Figure 13-10**) is associated with overactive/shortened hip extensors (e.g., hamstrings, adductor magnus) and underactivity of the hip flexors, spinal extensors, and latissimus dorsi.
    + Excessive forward lean of the trunk (Figure 13-11) and an asymmetric weight shift (Figure 13-12) are typically associated with dysfunction located outside of the LPHC (limited dorsiflexion ROM)
  + SLSA
    + asymmetric weight shift (Figure 13-15) and inward or outward trunk rotation
      ![image-20211023144328005](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023144328005.png)
+ Loaded movement
  + if a client can maintain a neutral pelvis during the OHSA and SLSA, but then demonstrates an anterior tilt during a loaded squat assessment, hip extensor musculature activation (e.g., gluteus maximus) can be prioritized in the client’s program.
+ Dynamic
  + anterior tilting (hips sagging toward the floor) or posterior tilting (hips rounding toward the ceiling) of the pelvis or excessive trunk motion
+ Mobility
  + one or more of the static postural distortion patterns (e.g., Janda’s syndromes and Kendall’s postures) and then demonstrates an anterior or posterior pelvic tilt, then lumbar flexion and extension tests, knee flexion and extension, hip abduction and external rotation, and the modified Thomas test may be assessed to pinpoint which muscles affecting LPHC movement warrant corrective programming.

### Corrections

#### Excessive forward trunk lean

+ General: deal dorsiflexion and hip extension as well as the body’s ability to decelerate and control hip flexion. 
+ Inhibit: soleus, gastrocnemius, and hip flexor complex (rectus femoris and TFL). 
+ Lengthen: gastrocnemius/soleus, hip flexor complex, and abdominal complex (particularly if lumbar flexion is concurrently observed)
+ Activate: anterior tibialis, gluteus maximus, and intrinsic core stabilizers
+ Integrate:  begin with a ball squat

![image-20211023150232868](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023150232868.png)



#### Excessive Anterior Pelvic Tilt - Low Back Arches

+ General: improve hip extension and improve the body’s ability to stabilize the LPHC
+ Inhibit: anterior fibers of the adductor complex as well as the hip flexor complex (psoas, rectus femoris, and TFL), spinal extensors, and latissimus dorsi.
+ Lengthen: hip flexor complex, spinal extensors, and latissimus dorsi. 
+ Activate: gluteus maximus and abdominal complex. 
+ Integrate: 
  + first include uniplanar exercises (sagittal plane) and then progress to multiplanar exercises (frontal and transverse). 
  + place the ball above the lumbar curve to prevent the individual from arching over the ball,
  + Squat to row progressions may also be useful to enforce proper coordination and activation of the posterior oblique subsystem. 

![image-20211023150446889](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023150446889.png)



#### Excessive Posterior Pelvic Tilt—Low Back Flattens

+ General: allow appropriate hip flexion
+ Inhibit: hamstrings complex, piriformis, and adductor magnus. 
+ Lengthen: hamstrings complex, piriformis, abdominal complex (rectus abdominis and external obliques in particular), and adductor magnus. 
+ Activate: gluteus maximus, hip flexors, and spinal extensors. 
  + it is unlikely the gluteus maximus is truly overactive. It is more likely that the adductor magnus and piriformis are synergistically dominant while compensating for an underactive gluteus maximus, contributing to posterior tilting of the pelvis.
+ Integrate: first include uniplanar exercises (sagittal plane) and then progress to multiplanar exercises (frontal and transverse). 

![image-20211023155222093](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023155222093.png)

#### Asymmetric Weight Shift

+ General: view it as a holistic frontal plane control issue.
+ Inhibit:
  + Opposite-side biceps femoris
  + Opposite-side gastrocnemius/soleus
  + Opposite-side piriformis
  + Same-side adductor complex
  + Same-side TFL
+ Lengthen: 
  + Opposite-side biceps femoris
  + Opposite-side gastrocnemius/soleus
  + Opposite-side piriformis
  + Same-side adductor complex
  + Same-side TFL
+ Activate:
  + Core stabilizers
  + Opposite-side adductor complex
  + Same-side gluteus medius
+ Integrate: same

![image-20211023155357060](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023155357060.png)



#### Trunk rotation

+ General: underactive gluteus maximus and medius muscles paired with overactive hip internal or external rotator muscles in the stance leg
  + inward rotation is seen, the TFL and adductor complex (hip internal rotators) are likely overactive. 
  + outward rotation is seen, the piriformis (a hip external rotator), posterior fibers of the adductor magnus, and biceps femoris are most likely overactive.
+ inward trunk rotation is seen on the SLSA, corrective protocols for knee valgus can be applied to whichever side of the body the rotation is seen
+ An outward trunk rotation on the SLSA is more rarely seen, but can often be addressed by inhibiting the piriformis, activating the gluteus maximus and medius, and practicing proper form for two-leg and single-leg squat movement patterns



## Common issues

### Low-back Pain

+ Status
  + U.S. society, with up to 35% of individuals experiencing reduced activity due to chronic back conditions and approximately 7% of that number with back issues that persist for 6 months or more
+ Symptoms
  + The lumbar spine pain referral locations are called dermatomes  
  + if there is a disc herniation at the L5–S1 level, it will cause possible pain and neurological symptoms (e.g., numbness and tingling) down the leg into the foot
  + higher spinal level (e.g., L1–L3) would produce symptoms in the LPHC.
    ![image-20211023161129114](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023161129114.png)
+ Cause
  + muscle imbalances, decreased mobility, disc pathology, facet joint dysfunction, joint degeneration (spondylosis), and spinal instability
  + Poor passive hip extension (Roach et al., 2015), increased anterior pelvic tilt (Król et al., 2017), increased lumbar lordosis (Hosseinifar et al., 2017), limited LPHC stability (McGill, 2016; Mitra & Mande, 2019; Puntumetakul et al., 2018), weak gluteus maximus (Amabile et al., 2017), weak gluteus medius (Cooper et al., 2016), too much sitting (Brakenridge et al., 2018), awkward trunk postures (Nourollahi et al., 2018), altered motor control of LPHC musculature (Roshini & Leo Aseer, 2019), and pelvic floor dysfunction
+ Approach
  +  improving motor control, mobility, isolated LPHC strength, lifting and ergonomics, and client education. 
  + **Abdominal Bracing Versus Abdominal Hollowing**
    + isometric spinal stabilization training is superior to dynamic exercises at developing LPHC stiffness 
    + Engagement of the transverse abdominis highly effective at minimizing low-back pain (LBP) and increasing LPHC stability. 
    + Evidence shows that deep abdominal muscles are more activated with abdominal hollowing and surface muscles are more activated with abdominal bracing
    + Abdominal hollowing was found superior to abdominal bracing for increasing LPHC stability and leg stiffness in hopping tasks 
    + abdominal bracing is one of the more effective techniques to activate the deep core musculature.
    + In early stages of the training, cueing abdominal hollowing may be considered a good starting point to ensure transverse abdominis activation.
    + abdominal bracing can be implemented immediately during core stabilization exercises to increase stiffness and minimize movement in the LPHC

### Intervertebral Disc Injury

+ Cause
  + Disc pressure increases with lumbar flexion and decreases in lordosis during the performance of activities. 
  + increase the strain placed on the discs and include flexion with lateral bending
  + compression combined with bending and twisting moments about the disc contributed to earlier degeneration in compromised intervertebral discs
  + Pelvic asymmetry alters static posture of the entire LPHC, which alters normal arthrokinematics 



### Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction

+ Cause
  + LPHC muscle imbalances, neuromotor weakness, trauma, overuse, poor sitting posture, and pregnancy. 
+ Symptom
  + posterior buttocks or sacroiliac region and can refer into the groin or down the posterior lateral leg to the knee in some individuals 
    ![image-20211023161221777](13-LPHC.assets/image-20211023161221777.png)
+ Correction
  + LPHC muscle stabilization exercises
  + enhancing flexibility of the hip flexors, quadriceps, adductor complex, and hamstrings complex



### Muscle Strains

+ General
  + muscle and or muscle–tendon unit.
  + occur if the muscle works beyond its capacity,resulting in a tear of the muscle fibers.
+ Symptom
  +  In mild strains, the client may report tightness or tension. 
  + In more severe cases, the client may report feeling a sudden tear or pop that leads to immediate pain and weakness in the muscle (**Table 13-8**) (Floyd, 2017). 
  + Swelling, discoloration (ecchymosis), and loss of function often occur after the injury (Cheatham & Kolber, 2016). 
  + Muscle strains related to the LPHC and lower kinetic chain extremity primarily occur in the quadriceps, hamstrings, and adductors (groin).
+ Cause
  + Muscle strains of the quadriceps and hamstring groups are often caused by a severe stretch to the muscle or a rapid, forceful contraction (e.g., sprinting). 
  + the hamstrings have the highest frequency of strains in the body and are common in running and jumping sports.
  + risk factors include but are not limited to prior injury of the same muscle, age, poor flexibility, lower extremity muscle imbalance, improper warm-up, and training errors 
  + Adductor or groin strains are common in sports such as soccer, ice hockey, and figure skating (Kerbel et al., 2018). These activities require explosive acceleration, deceleration, and change of direction.
